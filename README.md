# Line-us experiments

This repo contains some experiments with the [Line-us](https://www.line-us.com/) plotter. You can find a client implementation in `heyarne.line-us.connection`. It's an early work-in-progress, but it's quite usable already.

## Running doodles

Follow the [getting started guide](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) on the Clojure homepage to setup Clojure and run:

```
clj -m heyarne.line-us.doodles.one
```
